# ðŸ“ˆ Colby College Athletic Management System (Flask Web App)

## Abstract
The goal of this milestone was to develop a dynamic version of the Athletic Management System we have been working on. We used Flask to make a website that implemented the pages we had made for milestone 3 in html and css. Some of the dynamic features we added were a functional search bar, downloadable pdfs, permission controls, user login and user profiles. In addition, we implemented Flask modules to utilize functional features, such as authentication, and a database. We then put our files on the Github repository that our scrum master (Anna) had created and gave a short presentation to the class on what we had created.

In addition to constant communication through text, we met three times throughout the time allotted for milestone 4. We met on Friday the 21st and our goal for this meeting was to have a solid attempt of the parts we had previously agreed to each do and discuss specifics and how we wanted the pages to look so we could have uniformity across the website. We then met on Tuesday 25th and the goal for this meeting was to have the bulk of your page done not including little fixes and details. We also used this time to go over what everyone had done and give feedback. Our final meeting was on Wednesday the 26th and in this meeting it was expected that everyone had all their stuff done because we were going to merge all of our pages together and publish them onto the Github,

### Burndown Chart
![Burndown Chart image](/README-img/burndown.png)

The burndown chart shows our work throughout the 2 week period we had to do this milestone.
As you can see progress started off very slow but we all felt there were significant jumps when we met together.
Unfortunately due to very hectic conflicting schedules much of the progress we made was in the two nights before the due date so I think going forward we are going to try to meet earlier in the week.
